0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

DESCRIPTION.

AirBnB clone is a team of two project to clone AirBnB website. In this project,I went solo due to unavoidable circumstances. This is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine The Project will start with console interpreter to perform some operations that include;

create: Creates a new object from the base object. retrieve: Retrieves an object from a file. do: Performs an operation. destroy: Destroys an object.

HOW TO START,HKW IT WORKS WITH EXAMPLES.

Run the following command to start

./console.py Usage and Examples:

./console.py (hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help ):
EOF help quit

(hbnb) (hbnb) help quit Quit command to exit the program

(hbnb) (hbnb) (hbnb) quit

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py (hbnb)

Documented commands (type help ):
EOF help quit (hbnb) $ $ cat test_help help $ $ cat test_help | ./console.py (hbnb)

Documented commands (type help ):
EOF help quit (hbnb) $

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
